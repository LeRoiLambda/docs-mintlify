title: The Reservation object
openapi-schema: reservation
description: A Reservation represents a driver's intent to charge within a specific time window and geographic area. Reservations are initially virtual and managed by Charge. Around 30 minutes before the reserved window, Charge attempts to assign a real charging station and lock the reservation. This enables advanced scheduling even when underlying CPOs do not support native future reservations.
